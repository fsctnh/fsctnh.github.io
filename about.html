            &emsp; Felipe is currently attending the electronics course at ETEC Presidente Vargas. <br><br> &emsp; For basically my entire life, I've loved computers and browsing the internet, not sure if that's a good thing, though. I also love mountains and music,<br> &emsp; This website was built for fun, and intentionally made with HTML only, because i suck at web dev. (and also Flask because i wanted to try it out)<p>
